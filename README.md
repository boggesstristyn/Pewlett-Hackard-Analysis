# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to identify the number of retiring employees by title and department, as well as current employees that may be set to retire in 10 years. In order to prepare the managers for the "silver tsunami" at Pewlett Hackard, we were asked to provide the total count of employees by department that will be retiring. This information will provide the managers with an idea of how many employees in their department would be retiring in the upcoming year and what positions would need to be backfilled. These managers are also trying to be proactive and would like to propose that a new program be created in order to retain some of these employees.

- 1,549 employees could be eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary

As the "silver tsunami" begins to make impact, there will be over 70,000 vacancies in it's wake. There are only about 1,500 eligible mentee employees, so the gap is quite significant.
